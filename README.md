## Project Title
Temu Sales Data Analysis: Feature Exploration and Revenue Impact Study

## Project Overview
This project aims to explore Temu sales data to identify the most influential factors affecting total revenue. By examining features such as product price, category, customer feedback, and ratings, we provide a foundational analysis and suggest directions for deeper investigation and model development.

## Objectives
Understand how different features influence total sales revenue.

Identify key product categories and pricing strategies that drive revenue.

Lay the groundwork for further machine learning modeling and strategic recommendations.

## Methodology
Descriptive Statistics: Calculated median, variance, and interquartile range (IQR) for key features.

Visualization: Used bar charts and scatterplots to visualize revenue distribution across different categories and price points.

Comparative Analysis: Assessed the contribution of each item and category to total revenue.

Correlation Analysis: Explored relationships between customer feedback (comment counts) and ratings with revenue.

## Key Findings
1. Price and Product Category:
Sales revenue is heavily influenced by product price and category. The top contributing categories include Kid, Baby & Maternity, Home & Kitchen, Shoes, Women's Clothing, and Electronics & Appliances.
Revenue appears to be balanced between big-ticket, low-volume sales and low-cost, high-volume sales.

2. Customer Comments:
A slight correlation between the number of customer comments and revenue was observed. Further exploration into comment content is recommended.

3. Customer Ratings:
A slight correlation with revenue was also noted, indicating the need for deeper analysis.

## Future Work
1. Apply machine learning regression models to predict sales revenue.

2. Expand the dataset for greater accuracy and generalizability.

3. Conduct stricter statistical testing on key variables and include additional features.

4. Implement Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze customer comment content for more actionable insights.
